## Completed in this iteration
- Strategy Lab: target allocation, drift detection, rebalance suggestions, constraint handling.
- Stress Test: preset and custom shocks, portfolio PnL delta, top gain/loss contributors.
- Risk Attribution: 24h/7d contribution and volatility contribution outputs.

## Deferred intentionally
- Automated order execution.
- Predictive ML market timing.
- Multi-user account and permissions.

## Why these boundaries
- Keep this system deterministic and explainable.
- Ensure every output can be traced back to visible inputs.
- Preserve runtime stability for public deployment.
